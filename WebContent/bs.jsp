Note: Beginning in Fall, 2009, General Biology I and II were restructured. ABIO 110 and 111(Z) were longer offered. The Fall lecture/lab course ABIO 110 [4 cr] was replaced with the lecture ABIO 120 [3 cr] and the lab ABIO 122 [1 cr]; the Spring lecture/lab course A Bio 111(Z) was replaced with the lecture ABIO 121 [3 cr] and the lab ABIO 123Z [1 cr]. The lecture could be taken without the lab; the lab could only be taken at the same time as or after the corresponding semester's lecture. The major requirement for General Biology could be met either with ABIO 110 and 111(Z), or with ABIO 120, 121, 122, and 123(Z).

Beginning in Fall, 2013, the General Biology Labs were further restructured. ABio 122 and ABio 123Z were discontinued and replaced with ABio 201 and ABio 202Z. Thus, the General Biology labs are now generally taken the year after the lectures.

[From the 2015-16 Undergraduate Catalogue]
General Program B.S.: Combined major and minor sequence consisting of a minimum of 66 credits.
Required courses: 
A BIO 120 & 121, 201 & 202Z, 212Y, 217, 365, 402

15 additional credits in biology are also required, and must include at least 3 courses which are partially or exclusively laboratory courses.

Credits in A BIO 399/399Z and 499/499Z may be used to fulfill the requirement for 1 laboratory course if the student completes at least 4 credits over at least 2 semesters. A BIO 399/399Z and 499/499Z may contribute a total of 4 credits towards the major.
Courses that do not yield credit toward the major are so indicated in the individual bulletin descriptions.
